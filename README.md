# Simple LED Design Circuit using Arduino Uno

This project demonstrates a simple LED sequence circuit using an Arduino Uno. 
The LEDs turn ON one after another with a fixed delay, creating a running light effect.
It is a beginner-friendly Arduino project designed to understand digital output pins,
timing functions, and basic circuit connections.

This project is suitable for students who are learning Arduino basics and embedded systems.
